                    <p>There are fewer and fewer reasons to hire a developer for a simple website these days — and yet,
                        here you are! Maybe you want something a little special. Maybe you don't have the time, don't
                        want the headache. Maybe your idea's too weird, too big, or too annoying for drag-and-drop. </p>
                    <p>Whether you've got a big idea, a half-built site, or just a lot of questions, I'm here to sort

                            <p>I'm very taken with [certain] AI development and assistant tools and have lately enjoyed
                                exploring the possibilities. A very boring way to say: I've been nerding out over them
                                in my spare time, and want to do more. </p>
                            <p><em>Have an app or site idea? </em>Let's chat + see what
                                happens next. This kind of project may involve: rapid prototyping, AI tinkering and
                                play, prompt guidance, collaborative chaos, and impulsive experiments. Think of it like
                                a playground for
                                half-baked ideas with potential. Weird ideas welcome! <span class="pink"> Minimum
