                    <p>The hard-slash-fun truth is that AI and increasingly efficient + smart workflow tools are making
                        it
                        SO EASY for
                        non-developers to build almost whatever they want on the internet, and accomplish
                        previously-very-specialized digital
                        work, usually very quickly and inexpensively.</p>
                    <p>I've been building websites and focusing on the WordPress environment for over a dozen years,
                        happily
                        helping a slew of
                        small-business clients with development, hosting, and maintenance services.</p>
                    <p>Now, I'm helping Ross in the stairwell, yelling about pivoting, while Bob Dylan sings about times
                        a-changin' in the
                        background. The projects we do may look slightly different, but the level of service remains the
                        same. Snarky, sincere,
                        spectacular. Alliteration, like the guac, may cost extra.</p>

                            I love a bunch of buzzwords and a fancy bio as
                            much as the next girlie, but the bottom line is
                            I can code, I can speak in full sentences, and I
                            can help you get a handle on all the
                            best-practice bs when it comes to a small
                            business website. I don't love babysitting but I
                            do love keeping websites safe, alive, fast, and
                            pretty. This analogy breaks down pretty quickly,
                            but your website won't!

                            Lately I've been deep in my nerd era, exploring
                            new tools and playing with AI in ways that might
                            *actually be useful (or at least entertaining).
                            I'm still doing the foundational stuff — custom
                            code, maintenance, strategy — because solid
                            websites are still the backbone of a good online
                            presence.
