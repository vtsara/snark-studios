                    <p>The hard-slash-fun truth is that AI and increasingly efficient + smart workflow tools are making
                        it
                        SO EASY for
                        non-developers to build almost whatever they want on the internet, and accomplish
                        previously-very-specialized digital
                        work, usually very quickly and inexpensively.</p>
                    <p>I've been building websites and focusing on the WordPress environment for over a dozen years,
                        happily
                        helping a slew of
                        small-business clients with development, hosting, and maintenance services.</p>
                    <p>Now, I'm helping Ross in the stairwell, yelling about pivoting, while Bob Dylan sings about times
                        a-changin' in the
                        background. The projects we do may look slightly different, but the level of service remains the
                        same. Snarky, sincere,
                        spectacular. Alliteration, like the guac, may cost extra.</p>

                            I can code, I can speak in full sentences, and I
                            can help you get a handle on all the

                            do love keeping websites safe, alive, fast, and
                            pretty. This analogy breaks down pretty quickly,

                        added a
                        blog and she went the
                        extra mile and created videos so that I could learn how to properly create and post the new
                        content.
