  <h1>Hosting? Nope.</h1>
  <p>Almost as soon as I started my business in 2014, I started offering hosting services to my clients. It's been one of the easiest ways to add the most value in the web services department that I've seen, particularly for small businesses and other solopreneurs. But in 2024, we experienced a handful of childcare shakeups and by the start of 2025 it became clear I needed to scale back the more on-demand services I was offering to provide more on-demand services to my 3-year-old. I will miss solving this problem and being a resource! I am always available for questions, of course.</p>
  <p>If you are here actually looking for hosting services, I *highly* recommend my friend and colleague Alison Monday of tiny blue orange. Alison has been offering hosting services longer that I have, and is an expert in all-things-Wordpress.</p>
